- Welcome! I'm glad you found my personal website. I'm Yuqing, a doctoral student at the University of Birmingham and maintain these posts in my free time. The webpage documents several facets of my research journey. They are, for the most part, scholarly in nature. I hope you find them enjoyable! 
This site was built with the assistance of **CodeSheep**, a really kind and knowledgeable blogger.
**The content of the website will continue to be updated, please feel free to contact me!**
