Additional Tips for the Practical Driving Test:

Preparation: Familiarize yourself with the car you will be using for the test. Know where all controls are, such as indicators, lights, and wipers.

Mock Tests: Consider taking a few mock tests with your driving instructor to simulate the test environment and receive constructive feedback.

Maneuvers: Practice common maneuvers like parallel parking, reversing into a parking bay, and stopping at various types of junctions.

Mirrors: Frequently check your mirrors and demonstrate your awareness of the road situation around you.

Speed Awareness: Maintain appropriate speed limits, and remember that it's okay to drive below the limit if conditions require it.

Communication: Use your indicators timely and ensure you’re communicating your actions to other road users effectively.

Calmness: Stay calm and composed. If you make a minor error, don’t panic; many people pass despite making small mistakes.

Step-by-Step Guide to Navigating Roundabouts:

Approach:

As you approach the roundabout, check the road signs to understand the layout and exits.
Slow down and be prepared to give way to traffic coming from the right.
Signal:

Indicate your intended direction well before reaching the roundabout.
If turning left (first exit), signal left; if going straight, no initial signal is needed; if turning right (third or later exit), signal right.
Observation:

Look to the right and observe the traffic flow on the roundabout.
Give way to vehicles already on the roundabout; they have the right of way.
Entry:

When it's safe, enter the roundabout and keep to the correct lane.
For left-turn or straight-on, usually stay in the left lane; for right-turn, take the right lane.
Adjusting Signals:

If you're taking an exit to the right or going straight, indicate left after you've passed the exit before the one you want.
Exit:

Maintain a steady speed and use your mirrors.
Exit the roundabout carefully, making sure to signal and check for pedestrians and cyclists.
Post-Exit:

Once off the roundabout, turn off your signal and adjust your speed according to the road you’ve entered.
Remember: Roundabouts can vary in size and complexity. The key is to remain observant, signal your intentions clearly, and stay aware of the traffic around you.
