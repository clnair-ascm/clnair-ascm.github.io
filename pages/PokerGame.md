## My Curriculum Vitae

Update: 2022/01/19

### Cabo

- Objective

To be the player with the lowest value of the cards in front of them by either swapping them for
lesser value cards or by eliminating cards by pairing them up with cards of equal rank.

- The Deal

Each player is dealt 4 cards face down from the deck Both Jokers are included. The remainder
of the cards are placed face down to form the stockpile. The top card is placed face-up next to
the stockpile to form a discard pile. Players arrange their cards into a square formation in front
of them. Players my look at the two cards nearest to them ONLY and after memorising their
rank must replace them face-down back into the square formation. Once all players have done
this, the cards in front of the players may not be looked at until the end of the game or unless a
special card allows it. Players should also ensure their cards remain hidden from others.

- The Play

Beginning with the player to the dealer’s left, in clockwise order, players do either of three
things:
1. Pick a card from the stockpile and then may
a. Keep the card and place one of their own cards on the discard pile
b. Discard it
2. Pick a card from the discard pile and place one of their own cards on the discard pile
3. Call cabo

Players should keep all cards except those discarded hidden from the view of other players. If a
player calls cabo, the other players each get one more turn and then everyone has to lay down
their cards face up. The player with the lowest score wins.
Special Cards
If any of the following cards are discarded, the player discarding the card has the option of using
the cards ability.
● Black King: ‘Look & Swap’ - Look at another player's card and then choose whether or
not swap that card for one of their own.
● Queen / Jack: ‘Blind Swap’ - The player may swap one of their cards with another
player’s card but cannot look at it first.
● 9 / 10: ‘Look at another’s’ - Look at one of another’s players cards.
● 7 / 8: ‘Look at own’ - Look at one of your own cards

Snapping
Any time a card is discarded, players may take a card of matching rank from their own set of
cards or from another player’s hand and lay it on the discard pile. Only the first card layed may
remain and hence players must race against each other to be the first to lay a matching card.
If a player incorrectly lays a card (i.e. they thought it was a matching card but remembered
incorrectly), they must return the card to its original location and add two cards face down
in front of them. Conversely if a player successfully matches on of their own cards they may
remain with one fewer card for the remainder of the game. If a player matches one of an
opponent's card, they can move one of their cards to the newly formed gap in the opponents
formation.
Scoring
Once all players have turned over their cards, a player's score is determined as follows:
● 2-10 = Face value
● J = -1
● Q = 12
● Black Kings = 13
● Red Kings = 0
