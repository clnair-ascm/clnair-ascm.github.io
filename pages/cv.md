> ### Brief Biography

**Yuqing Dai** studied at the College of Geoscience in China University of Petroleum (Beijing) between 2011 and 2015 (Bachelor's degree). He obtained his Master's degree from the School of Geography, Earth and Environmental Sciences in University of Birmingham with distinction in 2017 and from the College of Geoscience in the China University of Petroleum (Beijing) in 2019, respectively.

Yuqing currently is a <span style="color:blue">**[PhD student](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yuqing-Dai)**</span> (2019.10-) in Atmospheric Science, School of Geography, Earth and Environment Sciences, University of Birmingham. He is now supervised by Prof. **[Rob MacKenzie](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/gees/mackenzie-rob.aspx)** after Dr.**[Xiaoming Cai](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaoming-Cai)**'s retirement. Yuqing is working on street canyon studies, with a focus on the coupled chemical and physical processes within urban street canyons. His research interestes include:

- Disperson of air pollution in urban street canyons
- Emission, chemical, and physical effects of VOC free-radical reactions on air quality
- Urban air quality modelling
- Air quality interventions Policy efficacy evaluation
